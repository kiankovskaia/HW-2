Description

I created the website for my friend who is a photographer. 
You can navigate on top of each page to contacts, portfolio and about. Sizes on the page adjust to display’s size.
All images on the website have borders.
The page contains <footer> with a message about copyrights.


Portfolio:
I used columns and rows to arrange photos for display.

I used tags <input> to place a form for a feedback.  Visitors can enter name, email and message and submit a request. When you click on submit cursor becomes “pointer”. Input’s boarders were designed using border-radius. Also, I used pseudoclass when you click on input, it changes  color. For the button “submit” I used one of Bootstrap’s styles.
